# Eliza Chatbot 

A Python-based reimplementation of the classic ELIZA chatbot, which mimics a Rogerian psychotherapist. This version uses regular expressions to recognize patterns in user input and generate reflective responses. 

---

##  Project Objectives

- Gain experience with Pythonâ€™s `re` and `random` modules.
- Simulate natural conversation using rule-based logic.
- Understand the challenges of natural language processing (NLP).

---

## How It Works

The chatbot uses pattern matching to detect user intents and responds with randomized, pre-defined replies. Responses are often reflective or questioning, in line with Rogerian therapy style.

### Example:

User: I am feeling sad.
ELIZA: Could you elaborate about this?
