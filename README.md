# Eliza Chatbot 

A Python-based reimplementation of the classic ELIZA chatbot, which mimics a Rogerian psychotherapist. This version uses regular expressions to recognize patterns in user input and generate reflective responses. 

---

##  Project Objectives

- Gain experience with Python’s `re` and `random` modules.
- Simulate natural conversation using rule-based logic.
- Understand the challenges of natural language processing (NLP).

---

## How It Works

The chatbot uses pattern matching to detect user intents and responds with randomized, pre-defined replies. Responses are often reflective or questioning, in line with Rogerian therapy style.

### Example:

> I feel sad.
> Could you elaborate about this?
> How often do you usually feel sad?
> Since when are you feeling this sad?
